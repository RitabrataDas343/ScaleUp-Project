![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)<br>

I have recently participated in an Event/Competition name 'Scale Up' conducted by Research and Development Cell, @CCA, where i have made an interesting Project. So, I'm extremely excited to share my learning with all of you.

"The project involves the usage of phone camera to work as scanners. In this project, we have connected the phone's camera with the laptop using IP Webcam and Python. Then we used some image processing techniques on the images and also converted the processed image into a pdf.

I have also added some extra features to it during the competition."

# Addition of Text Recognition

I have added the feature of text recognition using the module of pytesseract.

Technology used: Python, Image processing.

It was a great learning experience.

Thank you.
